My all too big game for a homework in a course in C++.


This repository has one special thing about it, it has
a branch, namned ‘variables’, that should never pull
any other branch. It is used to generate parts of the
code that is then pulled into the other branches.

For each tagged version ¤, there will a tagged version
of the branch ‘variables’ named ‘¤+var’.
